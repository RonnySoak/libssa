## Introduction

libssa is a library for SIMD accelerated optimal sequence alignments. This is project is currently developed as part of my master's thesis.

Its aim is to provide functionality for aligning query sequences against a sequence database. The main focus is here on:
* optimal global sequence alignments, using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
* optimal local sequence alignments, using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
* acceleration of the alignments using multiple threads and SIMD intructions
* a small public API

A main part of my thesis is to show the benefits of the AVX2 intructionset, for the speedup of optimal sequence alignments. [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is similar to [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) a set of intructions offering SIMD (Single instruction, multiple data) processing, on modern CPUs.

In the past, it had been shown, that a significant speedup can be gained using the SSE (TODO cite). AVX2 implements wider registers: 256 bit instead of 128 bit, with SSE. The hypothesis is, that it gets twice as fast, using AVX2 instead of SSE.


## Limitations

- exit on an error
- still work in progress
